          <h2>What are the NGOs:</h2>

          <h2>The Ocean Cleanup:</h2>
          <p>It is a non-profit organization that develops and implements technologies to help clean and remove plastic from the oceans, particularly from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Their work also involves collecting and recovering plastic that has ended up in the sea and preventing it, by adopting solutions to reduce the use of single-use plastic and improve recycling overall.</p>

          <h2>MoReTec-1:</h2>
          <p>MoReTec-1 is the name of the first large-scale commercial plant developed by LyondellBasell, located in Wesseling, Germany. This plant uses advanced chemical recycling technology, MoReTec, to transform cons plastic waste into high-quality raw materials for the production of new polymers. The planned capacity of the plant is 50,000 tons per year, equivalent to the amount of plastic packaging waste generated by over 1.2 million German citizens annually. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.</p>

          <h2>Corepla:</h2>
          <p>Corepla is an abbreviation for: Consorzio Nazionale per la Raccolta, il Riciclo e il Recupero degli Imballaggi in Plastica (National Consortium for the Collection, Recycling and Recovery of Plastic Packaging). It is a non-profit organization that brings together companies from the packaging supply chain operating in Italy at a national level for the recycling of plastic packaging, and is based in Milan.</p>
          <p>It was established in 1997 in accordance with Legislative Decree 22/97, which was later replaced by Legislative Decree 152/06. It succeeded the previous consortium, Replastic, which focused solely on the recovery of plastic containers for liquids.</p>

        <h2>Milano plastic free:</h2>
        <p>It is an initiative promoted by the Municipality of Milan in collaboration with Legambiente Lombardia and other local organizations, with the goal of reducing the use of single-use plastic in the city.</p>
        <h3>Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduction of single-use plastic</li>
          <li>Awareness-raising</li>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The initiative organizes events to raise awareness, and collaborates with schools and businesses.</p>
        <p>In 2024, Milan was recognized as a "Plastic Free Municipality" by Plastic Free Onlus, thanks to its commitment to reducing single-use plastic and promoting sustainable behaviors.</p>

        <h2>Valipac:</h2>
        <p>Valipac is a Belgian organization founded in 1997, a pioneer in Europe in the management of extended producer responsibility (EPR) for commercial and industrial packaging (C&I). Its mission is to support companies in achieving high recycling rates and promote the circular economy for industrial packaging. Currently, Valipac manages about 85% of the Belgian market, with over 6,200 clients and an overall recycling rate of 89.6% for the industry.</p>

        <h3>What Valipac does</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Circular design support:</strong> It promotes the use of recyclable materials and provides guidelines such as "Design4Recycling" and "Pack It Better".</li>
          <li><strong>Recycled content bonus:</strong> Financial incentives for packaging with 30% recycled plastic, €100/ton bonus from 2025.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance audits:</strong> At facilities including those abroad to ensure proper waste handling.</li>
          <li><strong>Innovative projects:</strong> Developed circular stretch/shrink films with recycled content.</li>
          <li><strong>Training and consulting:</strong> Valipac Academy offers courses on legislation and sustainability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact and objectives</h3>
        <p>Valipac has helped make Belgium a European leader in industrial packaging recycling, with recycling rates exceeding the European Union's 2030 targets. The organization aims to maintain and improve these results, addressing the challenges posed by European regulations, such as the revision of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (PPWR).</p>

        <h2>Circular economy:</h2>
        <p>It is a model of production and consumption that involves sharing, lending, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible.</p>
        <p>In this way, the life cycle of products is extended, helping to minimize waste. Once the product has reached the end of its useful life, the materials it is made of are reintroduced, where possible, through recycling. This allows them to be continuously reused within the production cycle, generating additional value.</p>

        <h2>Other Projects</h2>
