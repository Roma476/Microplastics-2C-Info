            <h3>What is plastic and some positive uses:</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>What is plastic?</strong> Plastic doesn't exist in nature, but it is derived from natural materials: primarily from petroleum, but also from coal and other natural gases. These materials undergo complex chemical processes that result in small particles capable of bonding together.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Positive uses:</strong> Plastic is easy to handle, can be shaped into any form, and can have any color or physical property. We can find it in our daily livesâ€”for example, in the form of shopping bags, water bottles, and much more.

            <h3>How does plastic pollution work?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Plastic Pollution - Summary</strong><br><br>
                Plastic pollution is a global environmental issue that harms wildlife, habitats, and human health. It is divided into land-based and marine pollution.<br><br>
                On land, plastic waste comes from packaging and disposable items, which break down into microplastics, affecting soil and animals. In the ocean, plastics harm marine life, break into microplastics, and can enter the food chain.<br><br>
                To address plastic pollution, we need to reduce plastic use, improve waste management, and raise awareness.

            <h3>How our understanding has changed regarding its impact on the environment:</h3>
            <p>
                Over the years, our awareness of the impact of human activities on the environment has grown. In the past, pollution and exploitation of natural resources were seen as inevitable for development. Today, thanks to scientific research, we know that these actions have serious consequences, such as climate change and biodiversity loss. The adoption of sustainable policies and environmental education are now priorities to promote a more balanced future, in which development and the environment can coexist.
