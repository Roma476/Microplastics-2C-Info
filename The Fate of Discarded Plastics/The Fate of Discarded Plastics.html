            <p >Henderson Island is an example for the plastic thrown in the ocean Henderson Island is a tiny, uninhabited island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean; more than 19 tons of trash litter its white, sandy beaches.<br> That’s means for every square meter you walk, on average you’ll find 672 pieces of trash. Though some of the debris might have come from illegal fishing boats (Henderson Island is located in a protected marine area where fishing is banned) or rigs,<br> much of the trash that ends up on the island is carried to it by the South Pacific Gyre, a powerful current that sweeps across the ocean.  </p>

                    <p><b>How did the plastic go in the ocean?</b><br>We can summarize the way it end up in the ocean in three point:<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The plastic it's lightweight so during the transport to landfill it may fly out the truck and end up in river or ocean</li>
                <li>Obviously drop the plastic garbage on the street because rainwater and wind carries plastic in the water </li>
                <li>Many of the products we use daily are flushed down toilets. Microfibres are even released into waterways when we wash our clothes in the washing machine.<br> They are too small to be filtered out by waste water plants and end up being consumed by small marine species, eventually even ending up in our food chain.</li>
            </ul>

                <p><b>Have you ever ask what happens to your plastic after you throw it away?</b><br><br> When we throw away plastic, it doesn't just disappear. Much of it ends up in landfils, which are enormous spaces where waste is put away. But plastic doesn't decompose like food or paper does. It offers to the evolving the environmental crisis and it can presist for hundreds of years. 
                    In these landfills, rainwater mixes with the waste, creating a dangerous liquid called leachate. This toxic mixture can seep into the ground and nearby rivers, threatening plants, animals, and even people who rely on these water sources. 
                    But not all plastic stays buried in landfills. A significant amount escapes into the environment—finding its way into streets, forests, and oceans. Animals, including fish and birds, may mistake plastic for food, leading to injury, illness, or even death.  </p>

                <p>Plastic pollution is a major environmental threat, with millions of tons ending up in oceans, rivers, and landfills each year, harming ecosystems. A global response is needed. Governments play a key role by passing laws to reduce plastic use, encourage recycling, and support sustainable alternatives, as shown by the EU’s ban on single-use plastics. However, consumers are just as important. Through everyday choices (reusing, avoiding excess packaging, and recycling properly) they can make a real impact. If current trends continue, there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050. Only by working together (governments, businesses, and individuals) can we solve this crisis and protect the planet.</p>

                <p><b>what is a leachate?</b><br><br>A leachate is a liquid that takes in substances from the material through which it passes, often making the liquid harmful or poisonous. A leachate is created when the rainwater ends up in the accumulated waste in the landfills and, as it passes through, it collects a mix of poisonous substances like heavy metals, organic compounds and chemical compounds. In December 2024, the European Council adopted a new regulation on packaging and packaging waste. The new rules set binding targets for reuse, limit the use of single-use packaging, and require the reduction of harmful substances, such as PFAS, in food contact materials. These measures aim to reduce packaging waste and improve environmental sustainability. </p>
