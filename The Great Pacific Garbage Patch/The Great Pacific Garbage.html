                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of debris that gets trapped in by the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. 
                    The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is formed by four different currents: the California current, the North Equatorial current, the Kuroshio current, and the north pacific current. 
                    The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is not visible to the naked eye, due to the plastics forming the patch being microplastics. 
                    The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is formed by three parts, the Eastern Garbage Patch, near California, the Western Garbage Patch, near Japan, and the Subtropical Convergence zone, that connects the two different Patches.

                <h2>How it forms?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is formed by rotating ocean currents called gyres. You can think of them as big whirlpools that pull objects: the gyres pull debris into one location, often the gyre center, forming patches. 
                    There are five gyres in the ocean: One in the Indian Ocean, two in the Atlantic Ocean, and two in the Pacific Ocean. 
                    Waste is formed and accumulated in the ocean by currents primarily through a process of transport and convergence. <strong>This is how it works:</strong>

                    <h2>1. Land-based Waste Enters the ocean</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most ocean waste, especially microplastics (tiny plastic fragments), also includes abandoned fishing nets, plastic containers, and everyday items. It enters the ocean through:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rivers (which carry litter from cities and industrial areas)</li>
                        <li>Stormwater drains</li>
                        <li>Wind-blown debris</li>
                        <li>Coastal littering</li>
                        <li>Improperly managed landfills near the coast</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>2. Ocean Currents Transport the Waste</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once in the ocean, this waste is picked up by surface currents. These currents are driven by: Wind, Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect), Water temperature and salinity differences.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h2>3. Accumulation of waste in gyres</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over time, this debris is pushed towards the center of ocean gyres, where the currents are weaker. Here the waste accumulates and concentrates, forming vast "spots" of garbage. 
                        It is estimated that it covers over 1.6 million km² (more than double the surface area of Italy).

                    <p>
                        This enormous mass of waste has serious effects on the marine environment:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marine animals (such as turtles, fish, and birds) can ingest plastic or become trapped in debris</li>
                        <li>Microplastics enter the marine food chain, with still little-known effects on human health</li>
                        <li>Plastic takes hundreds of years to degrade and can release toxic chemicals</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What is it made of</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is made of debris that break into tinier and tinier pieces, called microplastics. Many of these microplastics are not biodegradable. 
                        Microplastic cannot always be seen by the naked eye. Even satellite imagery does not show a giant patch of garbage. 
                        The microplastics of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch can simply make the water look like a cloudy soup, mixed with larger items, such as fishing gear and shoes.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How big is the great pacific garbage patch</h2>
                    <p>
                        The scale of the GPGP is so great, it is often imagined as a landmass. A 2018 study predicted at least 79,000 tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million sq km (618,000 sq miles), 
                        a figure that is four to 16 times higher than previously reported. This is twice the size of Texas or three times the size of France.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The impact on the marine life</h2>
                    <p>
                        The debris can harm the marine life in different ways, for example: The Loggerhead Sea Turtles mistake the plastic for Jellyfishes. 
                        These debris can block their internal organs making them unable to feed and die of starvation, or the plastic can rupture their internal organs killing them. 
                        Albatrosses mistake the plastics for fish eggs and feed them to their babies and making them starve to death or rupturing their internal organs. 
                        Marine Mammals are also at risk, they can get tangled in plastic, especially abandoned fishing nets drowning them. 
                        These nets can get in the ocean by illegal fishing and inclement weather, this phenomenon is called Ghost Fishing.
