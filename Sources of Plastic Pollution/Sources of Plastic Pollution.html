                    <i>How does plastic find its way into oceans, rivers, and forests despite increased awareness and regulations?</i><br>
                    The widespread use of plastic in various forms makes it challenging to control its environmental impact. 
                    Plastic pollution enters the environment through multiple pathways, many of which are not easily preventable. 
                    This includes synthetic fibers shed from clothing, microbeads in cosmetics, 
                    the breakdown of plastic bottles under sunlight (photodegradation), and plastic packaging. 
                    <br>In the following, we will identify and explain the main ways in which plastic pollution reaches our ecosystems

                    <h1>Synthetic Fibers from Clothing:</h1>
                    <p><strong>How it enters in the Environment:</strong> When we wash synthetic fabrics like polyester, nylon, and acrylic, tiny fibers (microfibers) are released into the water. These fibers are too small to be filtered out by wastewater treatment plants and end up in rivers, oceans, and lakes.</p>

                <div class="contenuto">
                    <h1>Poor Waste Management and Inadequate Maintenance:</h1>
                    <p><strong>How it enters in the Environment:</strong> In many parts of the world, waste management is inadequate, and large amounts of plastic are abandoned or not properly recycled. Plastic can be transported by wind, rainwater, or other natural phenomena.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="contenuto">
                    <h1>Photodegradation of Plastic Bottles:</h1>
                    <p><strong>How it enters in the Environment:</strong> Plastic bottles and other plastic waste, when exposed to sunlight, undergo photodegradation. This process causes the plastic to break into smaller pieces due to the sun's UV radiation, eventually transforming into microplastics.<br>
                    Even though plastic appears to degrade, it doesn't biodegrade completely. Instead, it breaks into tiny fragments (microplastics) that can persist in the environment for hundreds of years. These microplastics can be consumed by wildlife and enter the food chain.</p>

                <div class="contenuto">
                    <h1>Plastic Packaging:</h1>
                    <p><strong>How it enters in the Environment:</strong> Disposable plastic packaging, such as wrappers, bags, and containers, is one of the main causes of plastic pollution. These items are often discarded improperly, ending up on the streets, in landfills, or in water bodies.</p>

                <div class="contenuto">
                    <h1>Microbeads in Cosmetics:</h1>
                    <p><strong>How it enters in the Environment:</strong> Microbeads are small plastic particles used in products such as exfoliating scrubs, toothpaste, and some cosmetics. When rinsed off, they are flushed down the drain and can pass through wastewater treatment facilities.</p>
